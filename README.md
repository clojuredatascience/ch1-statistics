## Data

The data for this chapter has been sourced by the Complex Systems Research Group at the Medical University of Vienna. The analysis we've performed mirrors the research they have undertaken to determine the signals of systematic election fraud, including ballot stuffing. For more information on their research and the methods they employed looking at election data visit their website at http://www.complex-systems.meduniwien.ac.at/elections/election.html or download the paper by Peter Klimeka, Yuri Yegorovb, Rudolf Hanela, and Stefan Thurnerat here: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/20/1210722109.full.pdf.
